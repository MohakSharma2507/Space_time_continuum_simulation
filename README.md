Spacetime Continuum Simulation in VPython

Overview

This project visualizes the warping of spacetime caused by massive objects using VPython, a Python library that simplifies the creation of 3D animations and visualizations, making it ideal for physics simulations.

Physics Theory
	•	General Relativity: Proposed by Albert Einstein, General Relativity explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Massive objects, such as planets or stars, create “dents” or “wells” in the spacetime fabric, and other objects move along these curves, which we perceive as gravitational attraction.
	•	Spacetime Warping: In this simulation, the deformation of spacetime is represented by a dynamic grid. The curvature is stronger near massive objects and diminishes as the distance increases.
	•	Inverse Square Law: The degree of deformation follows the inverse square law: 

deformation ∝ -r/d^2
￼
where r￼is the mass radius, and d is the distance from the mass center.

Features
	•	Real-time 3D animation of spacetime deformation.
	•	Multiple masses with customizable sizes, positions, and colors.
	•	Dynamic spacetime grid illustrating gravitational effects.
